Welcome to Image_Classifier's documentation!
============================================

**Image_Classifier** is a Python library to create a model for image classifier and uses the tensorflow framework. 
It focuses on using pretrained models to generate models for a specific task. Though we can also use custom model.
Loading the dataset is also optimised and in case of lack of resources we can unset the optimisation.
